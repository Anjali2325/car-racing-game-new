Create a fun, playable 2D car racing game that runs entirely in the browser. GAME MECHANICS: 1) Top-down view racing game with player car that moves left/right using arrow keys or A/D keys, 2) Car automatically moves forward at constant speed, 3) Randomly generated opponent cars/obstacles coming from top of screen, 4) Collision detection - game over when player hits obstacle, 5) Score counter that increases over time, 6) Speed increases gradually as score goes up, 7) Road with lane markings that scroll down to create movement illusion, 8) Start/Restart button, 9) Game over screen showing final score and high score (stored in localStorage). VISUAL DESIGN: 1) Clean, colorful graphics using CSS and Canvas/SVG, 2) Smooth animations at 60fps, 3) Player car: simple top-view car shape (rectangle with rounded corners, different color), 4) Obstacle cars: various colors, 5) Road: dark grey with white lane markings, 6) Green grass on sides, 7) Score display in top corner, 8) Speed indicator, 9) Responsive design for desktop. TECHNICAL: Pure HTML5 Canvas/SVG + CSS + Vanilla JavaScript, no external libraries except maybe a simple pixel art style. Make it feel like a classic arcade racing game. Add sound effects (optional) for acceleration and collision using Web Audio API. The game must be fully playable and fun!
